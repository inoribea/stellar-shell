# astro-scripts

The scripts in this project are function calls for the fish shell and rely on the fish shell. They have not been tested on other terminals.

The scripts rely on astroquery. Please install it yourself to ensure normal calls.

(astroquery, astropy, tabulate, numpy, pandas, matplotlib)
